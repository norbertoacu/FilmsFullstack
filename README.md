### Pre-requisites 📋

_You will need to have installed a database manager, such as XAMP, WAMP, MySQLWorkBench, that works with MySQL._
_Remember that you have to have the db.config.js file well configured, with the name of the database and the user and password_
_I also recommend that you use an IDE of the Visual Studio Code type, which will make many of the tasks easier for you_
